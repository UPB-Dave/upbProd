								<p>“It is hard for [21<sup>st</sup>-century] Americans to
									imagine a world in which there was no music except what people produced for
									themselves. At the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, nearly every town in the
									Utah Territory, from Grouse Creek to Mammoth and Brigham City to Santa Clara, had
									their own brass band. Some estimates have the total number of brass bands as
									high as 200 at the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
									
									<p>“Perhaps nowhere was the brass band more appreciated than in
									pioneer Utah, where scores of bands were organized as settlements gradually
									filled the Territory from one end to the other … The Mormons were a
									particularly musical people, and it was probably true, as John Hyde observed,
									that ‘every third man in Utah was a fiddler.’ In their beleaguered exodus from
									Illinois to the Rocky Mountains, with room in wagons and carts for only the
									most precious of belongings, the pioneers brought several bands virtually intact,
									including the Nauvoo Legion Band and William Pitt’s Brass Band. Once in Utah,
									settlements were carefully organized to include people with musical skills. Music
									made life tolerable in the isolated mountain and desert valleys, hundreds of
									miles from nowhere.” - Notes for “Brassworks’ Centennial Band,” Dr. Roger
									Miller, former professor of music, University of Utah(Click here for additional information)</p>
									
									<p><b>Lehi Brass Band:</b> In 1871, the Lehi Brass band was
									organized by 28-year-old school teacher George William Thurman. Thurman had
									served in the Kentucky Home Guard Band during the Civil War. Tragedy struck
									that same year when Thurman was murdered by band member Jed Thurman, who he had
									earlier “chastised.” The murder took place in a church building as Thurman was
									putting up Christmas decorations for a celebration and concert. Later, the band
									“serenaded LDS Church President Brigham Young, Apostles George Q. Cannon and
									John Taylor, and other important church leaders when they visited Lehi in
									1874.” (Utah Historical Quarterly, Volume 74, Number 1, 2006)</p>
									
									<p><b>Plain City Brass Band:</b> One year (though the date was
									not recorded, probably in the 1880s), the Plain City Brass Band marched from Plain
									City to the Weber River with all the residents in wagons or on foot marching
									behind. The band consisted of two cornets, two alto horns, two tenor horns, one
									baritone, one tuba, a snare drum and a bass drum. A dance followed the
									celebration. On one occasion, the Plain City Band baseball team “arranged to
									play a team in Logan, followed by the usual band concert …. During the game, it
									was learned that the bodies of two Mormon missionaries from Hyrum, who had been
									killed by mobs in Tennessee, were due to arrive by train in Logan. The Plain
									City and Logan bands walked to the depot to meet the train, and then marched at
									the head of the funeral procession to Main Street, where the solemn cortege
									passed before the gathered crowd of mourners.” (Dr. Roger Miller)</p>
									
									<p><b>Pitt’s Brass Band/Nauvoo Brass Band:</b> This band, originally
									called Joseph’s City Band, was officially titled the Nauvoo Brass Band, but
									everyone called it Pitt’s Brass Band after William Pitt, the original
									organizer. After the murders of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, the band met the wagon
									carrying their bodies and march in front as the procession moved through the
									city. </p>
									
									<p>As the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
									Saints prepared to leave Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1846, the band tried to stay
									together to make the journey west. They accompanied Brigham Young and played along
									the trail as well as for many settlements in Iowa. They had to split up along
									the way, but eventually all the band members made it to the Salt Lake Valley. They
									performed at the October General Conference in 1848. They played for many
									Pioneer Day celebrations and for the laying of the cornerstones of the Salt
									Lake Temple in 1853. They also met the first handcart pioneer company as well
									as other groups as they entered the Salt Lake Valley.</p>
